# SeqWeb Bootstrap Script
# 
# This script initializes a SeqWeb development environment by:
# 1. Setting SEQWEBDEV_HOME environment variable
# 2. Creating initial seqweb.conf if none exists
# 3. Creating universal SeqWeb CLI entry point if none exists
# 4. Setting up bash integration
#
# Usage: curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seqweb/seqwebcode/main/bootstrap | bash
#
# Requirements:
# - Must be run from the intended SeqWeb dev home directory
# - User must have write permissions in the current directory
#

# Save previous value of SEQWEBDEV_HOME if it exists
