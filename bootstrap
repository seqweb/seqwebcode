# SeqWeb Bootstrap Script
# 
# This script initializes a SeqWeb development environment by:
# 1. Detecting the current directory as the SeqWeb dev home
# 2. Creating the seqweb.conf configuration file
# 3. Setting up the development environment
#
# Usage: curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seqweb/seqwebcode/main/bootstrap | bash
#
# Requirements:
# - Must be run from the intended SeqWeb dev home directory
# - User must have write permissions in the current directory
# - Git repositories should be cloned before running this script
#

set -e  # Exit on any error

# Save previous value of SEQWEBDEV_HOME if it exists
PREV_SEQWEBDEV_HOME="${SEQWEBDEV_HOME:-}"

# Set SEQWEBDEV_HOME to current directory and export it
export SEQWEBDEV_HOME="$(pwd)"

echo "Bootstrapping SeqWeb dev home environment in ($SEQWEBDEV_HOME) (was ${PREV_SEQWEBDEV_HOME:-<not set>})"

# TODO: Add bootstrap logic here
# - Create seqweb.conf with stub configuration
# - Run configuration wizard to populate repo paths
# - Set up CLI and shell integration
# - Complete the setup process
