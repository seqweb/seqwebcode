# SeqWeb Project AI Assistant Rules

## Persistent Directives

### "Going Forward" Directive
When the user prefixes a directive with "going forward", it remains in effect until notified otherwise. This directive applies to itself.

### Git Consolidate Directive
When the user requests "git consolidate", immediately:

1. **Phase 1**: Run `git status` to show pending changes
2. **Phase 2**: Provide a single concatenated command with:
   - `git add .`
   - `git commit -m "concise summary covering all changes"`
   - `git push`
   
No extra approval steps, preamble, commentary, or post-action summarization needed.
