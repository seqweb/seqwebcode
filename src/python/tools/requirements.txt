# SeqWeb CLI and Development Tools Dependencies
# This file manages dependencies for development tools, CLI commands, and dev process support
# that are distinct from core Python components in src/python/
#
# Current tools:
# - CLI command implementations and utilities
# - Development workflow automation
# - Build and deployment support tools

# Core CLI dependencies
# Currently using only standard library modules:
# - argparse, subprocess, pathlib, typing (all built-in)
# - No external dependencies required yet

# Future CLI dependencies (uncomment as needed):
# click>=8.1.0               # For building CLI applications
# typer>=0.9.0               # For modern CLI with type hints
