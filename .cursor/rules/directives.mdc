# SeqWeb AI Directives

## Persistent Directives

### "Going Forward" Directive
When the user prefixes a directive with "going forward", it remains in effect until notified otherwise. This directive applies to itself.

### Git Consolidate Directive
When the user requests "git consolidate", immediately:

1. **Phase 1**: Run `git status` to show pending changes
2. **Phase 2**: Provide a single concatenated command with:
   - `git add .`
   - `git commit -m "concise summary covering all changes"`
   - `git push`
   
No extra approval steps, preamble, commentary, or post-action summarization needed.

## Project Context
- SeqWeb converts OEIS sequence data to semantic web knowledge graphs
- Polyglot pipeline architecture with modules in Python, Java, Lisp, Bash
- Focus on development velocity and clean foundation for team collaboration
- Manual Draw.io export workflow with check_diagrams.py tool for maintenance

## Myriad Relationship
- Myriad is a temporary reference resource for seeding seqweb patterns
- Extract useful patterns but avoid direct myriad dependencies
- All myriad references should be segregated and removable
- Goal: seqweb becomes completely independent open-source effort
- Future participants won't know/care about myriad

## AI Interaction Patterns
- Use structured responses
- Include context in prompts
- Be explicit about requirements
- Provide examples when needed
- Document AI-related decisions
- Follow established directive patterns
