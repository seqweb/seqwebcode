# SeqWeb AI Directives

## Persistent Directives

# Note: Global directives are now stored in ~/.cursor/rules/global-directives.mdc
# This file contains only project-specific directives

## Project Context
- SeqWeb converts OEIS sequence data to semantic web knowledge graphs
- Polyglot pipeline architecture with modules in Python, Java, Lisp, Bash
- Focus on development velocity and clean foundation for team collaboration
- Manual Draw.io export workflow with check_diagrams.py tool for maintenance

## Myriad Relationship
- Myriad is a temporary reference resource for seeding seqweb patterns
- Extract useful patterns but avoid direct myriad dependencies
- All myriad references should be segregated and removable
- Goal: seqweb becomes completely independent open-source effort
- Future participants won't know/care about myriad

## AI Interaction Patterns
- Use structured responses
- Include context in prompts
- Be explicit about requirements
- Provide examples when needed
- Document AI-related decisions
- Follow established directive patterns
