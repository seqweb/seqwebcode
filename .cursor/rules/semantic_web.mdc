# SeqWeb Semantic Web Rules

## RDF Standards
- Use standard vocabularies where possible (rdf:, rdfs:, owl:, xsd:)
- Create custom ontologies for OEIS-specific concepts
- Document custom ontology extensions clearly
- Maintain clear namespace prefixes
- Keep schemas in ontology/ directory
- Use Turtle (.ttl) format for human readability

## OEIS-Specific Ontology
- Define OEIS sequence concepts and relationships
- Map mathematical properties to RDF predicates
- Create classes for sequence types and categories
- Define properties for sequence relationships
- Document all ontology decisions and rationale

## SPARQL Generation
- Generate valid SPARQL 1.1 queries
- Use clear variable names
- Include helpful comments
- Handle edge cases gracefully
- Support property paths for complex queries
- Optimize for Fuseki performance

## Data Quality
- Validate RDF output against ontology
- Check for missing required properties
- Ensure proper URI formatting
- Verify data type consistency
- Maintain referential integrity
- Log data quality issues

## Knowledge Graph Construction
- Build incremental graph updates
- Support graph versioning
- Maintain provenance information
- Include metadata about conversion process
- Support graph querying and exploration
- Enable graph analytics and visualization
